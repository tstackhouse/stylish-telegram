# Stylish Telegram
Some useful css overrides for [Telegram](http://www.telegram.org)'s web client to make it look more like the desktop clients and not waste screen real estate.

## Usage

* Install the [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/) Extension for your browser of choice
* Copy the code from styles.css into the extension

## TODO

* Make installation easier
* Publish on userstyles.org?


## History

I was using this locally and had a bunch of tweaks for the Telegram web UI, but foolishly didn't have a backup of all my rules, so I'm publishing the rules here as I recreate my old styles over time.  Eventually I'll post this up on userstyles.org.
